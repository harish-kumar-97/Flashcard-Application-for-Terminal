# Flashcard-Application-for-Terminal
A Linux terminal application which allows users to register themselves and the registered users to login. After login users can take a tests on shell. This user will have to provide the list of questions that he wants to take the test on. This tool acts just like a flashcard to help users to practice the questions.
